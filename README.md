# OOP_py 🚀

This repository explores key concepts in Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). They focus on designing custom classes, 
implementing inheritance, and leveraging polymorphism to create dynamic and reusable code.

---

## Part 1: Design Your Own Class 🏗️

The first part focuses on custom class representing anything you like with the following concepts:
- Creating a class with attributes and methods.
- Using constructors (`__init__`) to initialize object properties.
- Exploring inheritance to extend the functionality of a base class.

### Example Output:
```python
❯ python class.py
I am Thunderbolt, with the power of Lightning Speed!
I am TechBlade, and my gadget is a Energy Sword!
Sky Realm
```

## Part 2: Polymorphism 🎭

This activity demonstrates polymorphism by creating a set of classes with the same action (move()), but each class defines 
the action differently. This emphasizes reusability and dynamic method behavior.

### Example Output:
```python
❯ python polymorphism.py 
Driving 🚗
Flying ✈️
Sailing ⛵
```
